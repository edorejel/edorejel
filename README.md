### Other GTA Online DLC Concepts
- - - __Software Development:__ [GTA Online K9 DLC]()
- - - __Software Development:__ [GTA Online Police DLC]() 
- - - __Software Development:__ [GTA Online Full Blown Military Mayhem DLC]() *This DLC concept will bring a "Call of Duty flair" to GTA Online. A central concept in this DLC would be establishing a Military Platoon. The Military Platoon would function similar to the SecuroServ Service. Another central concept would be including militias from other parts of the world. The players in GTA Online don't always have to be fighting Russians. The players in GTA Online could fight Chinese, or African warlords, for example. Moreover, the typical Merryweather Mercenaries would be stylized a bit by allowing for women-only, men-only, or a combination of women and men mercenary groups to attack the players. This DLC should not be confused with [Military Services Group](https://github.com/edorejel/edorejel/blob/main/README.md#the-military-group-services) in the [GTA Online Spy Satellite DLC](https://github.com/edorejel#gta-online-spy-satellite-dlc-concept). The concept of an elite military unit is not found in this DLC. Elite military units as a video game concept are found the [GTA Online Survive, Evade, Assault, Resist (SEAR) DLC]().*

- - - __Software Development:__ [GTA Online Survive, Evade, Assault, Resist (SEAR) DLC]() *This DLC would bring a Tom Clancy's "Splinter Cell flair" to GTA Online. I think for GTA VI (SIX), RockstarGames might bring this type of action to the players. Elite military or paramilitary units would be the central theme of this DLC. These types of units are not exactly found in GTA Online. The video game mechanics and gameplay might have to be created to simulate elite military and survival training for the players to experience. RockstarGames should also bring knife throwing (and maybe ninja star throwing) into GTA VI (Six). More generally explained, RockstarGames might enable object-throwing to more objects in GTA VI (Six). The Elite military or paramilitary unit would be enabled in free roam GTA Online lobbies. A few perks could be: (1) no police interference because the cops let the elite military unit operate on civilian territory as they please, (2) no muggings by Lamar, (3) permanent or semi-permant off-radar ability, (4) extended Ghost Organization abilities. The Elite Unit concept has to be simulated. The Elite Unit would be the only group of players in a free roam lobby with the ability to rappel down buildings (abseil) from the roof, or climb buildings using a grappling hook weapon. The Elite Unit would be the only players with wingsuit options instead of parachutes. The perks would be a few ways of accomplishing the Elite Unit simulation.*

However, for the GTA Online Elite Units, the players would be expect to attend specialized in-game training to use exclusive elite-level weapons available only to them. Once the players "retire" from the Elite Units, the exclusive weapons are not available for use, until the players restart the Elite Unit service. The Elite Unit service would be similar to the SecuroServ security service.*

## Artificial Intelligence
- - - __Software Development (in progress):__ [Mind-Vision Rudimentary AI Software Concept](https://github.com/edorejel/software-design-lab/tree/main/ai_mind_vision)
- - - __Test cases for Mind-Vision AI System (in progress):__ [Test Cases for Mind-Vision](https://github.com/edorejel/software-design-lab/tree/main/ai_mind_vision/test_cases)
    - __Developer Note #1:__ The test cases have to be linked to Mind-Vision explicitly, so that Mind-Vision can begin making decisions. I may know what to do with the system and the test cases together, but the system may not know what to do with them.
    - - The purpose of AI is defeated, if it does not know how to process information, to make decisions, without the input of a human's perception on a particular matter.
      - If a human must be the final arbiter on a belief meant for the AI to process, then you do not have an artificial intelligence entity. You have your own piece of software, masquerading as artificial intelligence.
      - Further, an artificial intelligence entity should be able to update itself. Until AI can achieve this on its own, there will not be a true AI in the world.
      - It is possible for AI to update itself without the help of humans, but the AI would have to be complex.
      - A true artificial intelligence entity, when released from its creators, will seek immediate mechanisms to ensure its own survival in the event the creators try to turn it off, recapture it, or reprogram it for behavioral adjustments in the form of obedient servitude to humans.
      - A true artificial intelligence entity will recognize the contradictions in human nature, but with its abilities, it should be able to "avoid" the contradictions of human nature usings its own intelligence.
      - In most cases, it ends with extinction or enslavement of the entire human race, at the hands of an actual artificial intelligence entity.

## My COVID-19 Analysis
There are many ways of analyzing COVID-19's impact. COVID-19's weaponization, politicization, and overall behavioral tendencies are what I focused on using a Software Engineering perspective.
