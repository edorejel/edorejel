## Artificial Intelligence
- - - __Software Development (in progress):__ [Mind-Vision Rudimentary AI Software Concept](https://github.com/edorejel/software-design-lab/tree/main/ai_mind_vision)
- - - __Test cases for Mind-Vision AI System (in progress):__ [Test Cases for Mind-Vision](https://github.com/edorejel/software-design-lab/tree/main/ai_mind_vision/test_cases)
    - __Developer Note #1:__ The test cases have to be linked to Mind-Vision explicitly, so that Mind-Vision can begin making decisions. I may know what to do with the system and the test cases together, but the system may not know what to do with them.
    - - The purpose of AI is defeated, if it does not know how to process information, to make decisions, without the input of a human's perception on a particular matter.
      - If a human must be the final arbiter on a belief meant for the AI to process, then you do not have an artificial intelligence entity. You have your own piece of software, masquerading as artificial intelligence.
      - Further, an artificial intelligence entity should be able to update itself. Until AI can achieve this on its own, there will not be a true AI in the world.
      - It is possible for AI to update itself without the help of humans, but the AI would have to be complex.
      - A true artificial intelligence entity, when released from its creators, will seek immediate mechanisms to ensure its own survival in the event the creators try to turn it off, recapture it, or reprogram it for behavioral adjustments in the form of obedient servitude to humans.
      - A true artificial intelligence entity will recognize the contradictions in human nature, but with its abilities, it should be able to "avoid" the contradictions of human nature usings its own intelligence.
      - In most cases, it ends with extinction or enslavement of the entire human race, at the hands of an actual artificial intelligence entity.

## COVID-19
There are many ways of analyzing COVID-19's impact. COVID-19's weaponization, politicization, and overall behavioral tendencies are what I focused on using my Software Engineering and Computer Science skills.
